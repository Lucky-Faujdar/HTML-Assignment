        <li><h3>"rowspan":</h3>This attribute allows a cell to occupy and cover multiple rows, making it taller than a single row which 
            means spanning a cell against several rows. To use rowspan, we need to include this attribute within <td> or

            should span.</li>

            makes your table organized and easy to understand.</li>
        <li><h3>thead-Tag,tbody-Tag, tfoot-Tag:</h3>By using these elements, like and we make it easier for tools like screen readers to 
            understand and show the table information in a better way to people who can't see the screen well</li>

            <li><h3>action:</h3>The action attribute is like specifying the address where you want to send your form. It tells the browser where 
                to submit the form data. The action attribute might look like this: action="/signup_process". This means the 
                form data will be sent to the "/signup_process" URL on some website server.</li>
